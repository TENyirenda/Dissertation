Compared to Chat-GPT-4,  this model version also has better capabilties for application to generate human-like text for chatbots, virtual assistants, content generation and research. Although the chosen model is known to more likely hallucinate, this will be handled in the methods utilised throughout the report. Methods such as parsing, memory buffer and chains (chain-of-thought reasoning) will be tested and evaluated to produce more empathetic and sensitive responses/answers, enhancing empathy and accuracy in the LLM generations.

    "LLM's are stateless and have a tendancy to forget previous parts of conversations had with them. This term is known as 'catastrophic forgetting'. This segment on memory aims to improve memory for conversational flow during interactions for applications such as chatbots and virtual assistants. Each trasncation (each call to the API) to the LLM is independent therefore chatbots only appear to have memory after being provided full conversation as context (usually by the provision of rapid code). This application of memory aids in the accucuracy of responses by maximising context of conversation and mitgates hallucinations by keeping history of previous context of the conversation to stay inline of conversation topic. The utterances stored as memory are used as input that are passed to the LLM to generate an output. It is important to note that as the memory increases, the number of tokens sent to the LLM also increases, simultaneously increasing costs. However, LangChain provides several types of memory stores to accumulate conversation. Conversation Buffer Window Memory allows for the number of previous utterances to be remembered and be specified using a k=n arguemnt in the ConversationBufferMemory() class, only using the last K interactions. Conversation Token Buffer Memory allows for a limited number of tokens relating to the most recent exchanges of the LLM to be specified,rather than the number of interactions, then uses this to determine when to flush interactions. Conversation Summary Buffer memory, instead of limiting the number of tokens to a fixed number of conversational exchanges or basing the memory on the most recent utterances, uses the summary of a conversation so far as memory, storing explicit information of the message from the specified number of tokens and using CLM to generate the rest. The LangChain memory capability focussed on for this report is Conversation Buffer Memory most suited and effective memory store method for the use case in this report. This method stores the messages and then extracts them in a variable."

It should also include a thorough assessment of the individual's anxiety symptoms, including the severity, duration, and impact on daily functioning.\\n\\n2. Screening for co-occurring disorders: Individuals with a history of substance misuse are at increased risk for developing anxiety disorders, so it is important to screen for other mental health disorders that may be present, such as depression, PTSD, or bipolar disorder.\\n\\n3. Differential diagnosis: It is important to differentiate between substance-induced anxiety and primary anxiety disorders. This may require a period of abstinence from substances in order to determine the underlying cause of the anxiety symptoms.\\n\\n4. Collaborative treatment planning: Treatment for individuals with co-occurring anxiety and substance use disorders should be individualized and may involve a combination of pharmacological and psychotherapeutic interventions. It is important to involve the individual in the treatment planning process and to address both the anxiety symptoms and the substance use issues simultaneously.\\n\\n5. Ongoing assessment and monitoring: Regular assessment of the individual's symptoms, substance use, and treatment progress is essential in order to adjust the treatment plan as needed and to ensure that the individual is receiving the appropriate level of care.\\n\\nOverall, the best assessment guideline for anxiety with a substance misuse history is one that takes a holistic approach to the individual's mental health and substance use issues and provides comprehensive and integrated treatment to address both concerns.\""

    "Question Answering (Q&A) creates capability for an LLM to answer questions on top of a document/data. In this segment of the report, the aim is to use the LLM to answer questions in the context of a document to add context. In this way, the LLM is combined with data that the model was not originally trained on, enabling flexibility and adaptability to the use case. This use of this method explores the aid in mitigating hallucination and improve the accuracy of generated responses from the LLM by gaining depper understanding and enabling access to needed information. This acts as the introduction to vector stores and embeddings which will later be explored in this report using methods of Retrieval Augmented Generated (RAG) to aid LLM in information retrieval that improves context and accuracy of responses. It is important to note LLM's can only inspect a few thousand words at a time, which is where embeddings and vector stores help. The Embeddings create numerical representations for pieces of text that captures the semantic meaning. Texts with similar content will have similar vectors, which enables comparison of pieces of text in the vector space. These vector representations can then be stored in a vector database as small chunks of texts by the utilisation of embeddings. This way only the most relevant chunks can be passed to the LLM. from the embeddings, indexes are created. These indexes can then be used during runtime to find the pieces of text that are most relevant to an incoming query. When an incoming query comes in, an embedding is created for it. The embeddings are then compared to all the vectors in the database to find the most similar. When these are returned, they can be passed in the prompt to the LLM to get the final answer/response."

Anxiety is a normal human reaction to stressful\\nsituations. But for people with anxiety disorders, those fears and worries aren’t temporary. Their anxiety persists, and can even get worse over time.\\nAnxiety disorders can severely impair a person’s ability to function at work, school and in social situations.\\nAnxiety can also interfere with a person’s relationships with family members and friends. Fortunately, there are effective treatments for anxiety.\\nIn some cases, medications have a role in treating anxiety disorders. Yet research shows behavioral\\ntreatment, alone or in combination with medication, is a highly effective treatment for most people with\\nan anxiety disorder.\\nUnderstanding anxiety\\nAnxiety disorders are common in both adults and children. About\\n18 percent of U.S. adults and 25 percent of adolescents ages 13 to\\n18 will experience anxiety, according to the National Institute of\\nMental Health. About 4 percent of adults and nearly 6 percent of teens have anxiety disorders classified as severe.\\nThere are several major types of anxiety disorders:\\n• Generalized anxiety disorder  is characterized by persistent\\nworry or anxious feelings. People with this disorder worry\\nabout a number of concerns, such as health problems or finances, and may have a general sense that something bad is going to happen. Symptoms include restlessness, irritability, muscle tension, difficulty concentrating, sleep problems and\\ngenerally feeling on edge.\\n• Panic disorder  is marked by recurrent panic attacks that\\ninclude symptoms such as sweating, trembling, shortness of\\nbreath or a feeling of choking, a pounding heart or rapid heart rate, and feelings of dread. Such attacks often happen suddenly,\\nwithout warning. People who experience panic attacks often become fearful about when the next episode will occur, which\\ncan cause them to change or restrict their normal activities.\\n• Phobias  are intense fears about certain objects (spiders or\\nsnakes, for instance) or situations (such as flying in airplanes) that are distressing or intrusive.• Social anxiety disorder  is also known as social phobia.\\nPeople with this disorder are fearful of social situations in which they might feel embarrassed or judged. They\\ntypically feel nervous spending time in social settings, feel\\nself-conscious in front of others, and worry about being\\nrejected by or offending others. Other common symptoms\\ninclude having a hard time making friends; avoiding social situations; worrying for days before a social event; and\\nfeeling shaky, sweaty or nauseous when spending time in  \\na social setting.\\n• Obsessive-compulsive disorder  is characterized\\nby persistent, uncontrollable feelings and thoughts (obsessions) and routines or rituals (compulsions). Some\\ncommon examples include compulsive hand washing in\\nresponse to a fear of germs, or repeatedly checking work  \\nfor errors. BEYOND WORRY\\nHOW PSYCHOLOGISTS HELP WITH ANXIETY DISORDERS\\nAbout 18 percent of U.S. adults and\\n25 percent of adolescents ages 13–18\\nWILL EXPERIENCE ANXIETY MentalHealth.gov\\nLet’s talk about itPsychologistLocator.org\\nFind a psychologistapa.org/helpcenter\\nLearn more about how psychologists help\\n• Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) can develop after\\na severe physical or emotional trauma such as a natural\\ndisaster, serious accident or crime. Symptoms include\\nflashbacks of the trauma, nightmares and frightening\\nthoughts that interfere with a person’s everyday routine for\\nmonths or years after the traumatic experience.\\nSeeing a psychologist about\\nanxiety disorders\\nThough many types of anxiety disorders exist, research\\nsuggests that most are driven by similar underlying processes.\\nPeople with anxiety disorders tend to become easily\\noverwhelmed by their emotions, and they tend to have\\nparticularly negative reactions to those unpleasant feelings\\nand situations.\\nOften, people try to cope with those negative reactions by\\navoiding situations or experiences that make them anxious.\\nUnfortunately, avoidance can backfire and actually feed the\\nanxiety.\\nPsychologists are trained in diagnosing anxiety disorders and\\nteaching patients healthier, more effective ways to cope. A\\nform of psychotherapy known as cognitive-behavioral therapy\\n(CBT) is highly effective at treating anxiety disorders. Through\\nCBT, psychologists help patients learn to identify and manage\\nthe factors that contribute to their anxiety.\\nThrough the cognitive component of therapy, patients learn\\nto understand how their thoughts contribute to their anxiety\\nsymptoms. By learning to change those thought patterns, they\\ncan reduce the likelihood and intensity of anxiety symptoms.\\nWith the behavioral component, patients learn techniques to\\nreduce undesired behaviors associated with anxiety disorders. By learning to change their thought patterns\\n(through therapy), patients can reduce the\\nlikelihood and intensity of anxiety symptoms.Specifically, patients are encouraged to approach activities and situations that provoke anxiety (such as public speaking\\nor being in an enclosed space) to learn that their feared\\noutcomes (such as losing their train of thought or having a\\npanic attack) are unlikely.\\nPsychotherapy for anxiety\\ndisorders: What to expect\\nPsychotherapy is a collaborative process where psychologists\\nand patients work together to identify specific concerns\\nand develop concrete skills and techniques for coping with anxiety. Patients can expect to practice their new skills outside\\nof sessions to manage anxiety in situations that might make\\nthem uncomfortable. However, psychologists won’t push\\npatients into such scenarios until they’re sure they have the\\nskills they need to effectively confront their fears.\\nPsychologists sometimes use other approaches to treat anxiety\\ndisorders in addition to CBT. Group psychotherapy, which\\ntypically involves several people who all have anxiety disorders, can be effective for both treating anxiety and providing\\npatients with support. Family psychotherapy can help family members understand their loved one’s anxiety and help them\\nlearn ways to interact that do not reinforce anxious habits. Family therapy can be particularly helpful for children and\\nadolescents suffering from anxiety disorders.\\nAnxiety disorders are very treatable. The majority of patients\\nwho suffer from anxiety are able to reduce or eliminate\\nsymptoms after several (or fewer) months of psychotherapy,\\nand many patients notice improvement after just a few\\nsessions.\\nPsychologists are highly trained and will tailor a treatment plan\\nto address the unique needs of each patient.

Such attacks often happen suddenly, \\nwithout warning. People who experience panic attacks often become fearful about when the next episode will occur, which \\ncan cause them to change or restrict their normal activities.\\n• Phobias  are intense fears about certain objects (spiders or \\nsnakes, for instance) or situations (such as flying in airplanes) that are distressing or intrusive.• Social anxiety disorder  is also known as social phobia. \\nPeople with this disorder are fearful of social situations in which they might feel embarrassed or judged.

With the set of responses returned, the 'k' most diverse answers can be selected. The parameter can be controlled to determine how many responses are returned based in semantic similarity. With this smaller set of document, optimisation can be performed to select, not only the most relevant responses based on the semantic similarity search, but also on the responses that are diverse.

It can be useful to extract just the most relevant parts of retrieved passages. For example, when a question is asked the whole of a document that has been stored, even if only some of the document or some sentences are the most relevant parts. However, with compression, all the documents can be run through a LLM and have the most relevant parts extracted and then have the most relevant segments passed into a final LLM call.It is important to note the trade-off of using this method as this method can come at a higher cost as more calls are made to the LLM, but can be good for focussing on the final answer solely on the most important information."

    "In previous methods, by default the 'stuff' technique has been used that combines all the documents into the final prompt. It is cost-effective as it involves one call to the LLM. However, there are limitations with this technique if a large amount of documents are being used. This is because the size of the documents may not always be able to fit inside the context window. Therefore, there are other techniques such as Map_Reduce, Refine and Map_rerank, that can address these context window limitations. The Map_Reduce technique works by first sending each individual document to the LLM by itself to obtain an original answer, then the answers are composed into a final response to make a final call to the LLM. Athough this is more costly and less time effective, as it makes more calls to the language model and runs slower than other techniques, the advantage is that this technique can operate over arbitrarily many documents. The refine method makes sequential calls to an LLM chain by combining previous response with new data and asks for an improved response. The refine method allows for more conext and for the existing answer to be refined if needed. It encourages more carrying over of information than the Map_reduce technique."

    "Low-Rank Adaptation is a Parameter-Effecient Fine Tuning (PEFT) technique. It is a powerful technique for adapting pre-trained models to new tasks efficiently by reducing the number of parameters that need to be updated during fine-tuning. It focuses on reducing the number of parameters needed to fine-tune a model while maintaining performance by leveraging low-rank decomposition to maintain model performance while significantly cutting down on computational resources. Fewer parameters to update means lower memory usage and faster training times and a feasible to fine-tune very large models on small datasets or using limited computational resources. LoRA can be applied to various types of tasks, making it a versatile approach for model adaptation. While LoRA's primary function is to enhance the efficiency and feasibility of fine-tuning large models, its ability to make this process accessible and iterative can significantly contribute to bias mitigation by enabling efficient, resource-friendly fine-tuning that ensures the model is customised, up-to-date, and inclusive. By enabling frequent updates with diverse datasets and promoting a broader participation in model adaptation, LoRA can help create more balanced and fair AI systems. This approach not only makes high-quality mental health support more accessible but also ensures it is equitable, sensitive, and effective in addressing the diverse needs of individuals seeking help. In this report, the LLM will be adapted to focus on the specific tasks of question-answering for the particular domain of interest. "

    "The BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy) score is a metric used to evaluate the quality of machine-generated translations compared to one or more human-generated reference translations. It is a widely used metric in the field of natural language processing and machine translation. It quanititatively measures how closely a machine-generated translation matches one or more reference translations done by humans to improve translation quality. BLEU scores range from 0 to 1, where 1 indicates a perfect match with the reference translations. While BLEU is useful, it has been criticized for not always correlating well with human judgments of translation quality, especially in cases where translations differ significantly in word choice or structure but convey the same meaning effectively."

    "1. Mindfulness and Meditation: Have you ever tried mindfulness or meditation? It can be really grounding. There are some great apps like Headspace or Calm that can guide you through it. It might help to just sit and breathe for a few minutes each day. \\\n",
    "2. Deep Breathing Exercises: When your thoughts start to race, try taking a few deep breaths. Breathe in slowly through your nose, hold it for a few seconds, and then exhale slowly through your mouth. It can be surprisingly calming. \\\n",
    "3. Write It Down: Sometimes, writing down your thoughts can help get them out of your head. Even just a few minutes of journaling can make a difference. \\\n",
    "4. Get Moving: Physical activity can really help clear your mind. Even a short walk can make a big difference. Plus, it's a good way to break the cycle of repetitive thoughts. \\\n",
    "5. Engage in a Hobby: Doing something you love can be a great distraction. Whether it's painting, playing music, or reading a book, find something that brings you joy. \\\n",
    "6. Limit Caffeine and Sugar: These can sometimes make anxiety worse. Try cutting back, especially later in the day, and see if it helps. \\\n",
    "7. Break Down Your Worries: If you can, try to break down what's bothering you into smaller, more manageable parts. Tackling one thing at a time can make it all feel less overwhelming. \\\n",
    "8. Talk to Someone: It can be really helpful to talk things through with someone you trust. Whether it's a friend, family member, or therapist, sharing what you're going through can provide some relief. \\\n",
    "9. Professional Help: If these feelings are becoming too much to handle, a mental health professional can offer support and strategies tailored to you. There's no shame in seeking help—it's a strong and positive step. \\\n",

    "reference = \"That's a great question. Coping strategies can really vary depending on what works best for you, but here are some ideas that might help: \\\n",
    "1. Deep Breathing Exercises: When you're feeling overwhelmed, try taking slow, deep breaths. Focus on your breath going in and out—it can help calm your mind. \\\n",
    "2. Mindfulness or Meditation: Taking a few minutes each day to practice mindfulness or meditation can be really grounding. It's about being present in the moment and letting go of worries. \\\n",
    "3. Progressive Muscle Relaxation: This technique involves tensing and then relaxing each muscle group in your body, one at a time. It can help reduce physical tension and promote relaxation. \\\n",
    "4. Journaling: Writing down your thoughts and feelings can be a great way to process emotions. It can also help you identify patterns or triggers for your anxiety. \\\n",
    "5. Physical Activity: Exercise is a powerful stress reliever. Whether it's going for a run, doing yoga, or even just dancing around your room, moving your body can help release tension and boost your mood. \\\n",
    "6. Limiting Stimulants: Caffeine and sugar can sometimes make anxiety worse, so cutting back on these might help. \\\n",
    "7. Setting Boundaries: Learning to say no and setting limits on your commitments can reduce stress and overwhelm. \\\n",
    "8. Connecting with Others: Talking to friends, family, or a support group can provide emotional support and perspective. \\\n",
    "9. Seeking Professional Help: Sometimes coping strategies aren't enough on their own, and that's okay. A therapist can provide additional tools and support tailored to your specific needs. \\\n",
    "It's all about finding what works best for you. It might take some trial and error, but be patient with yourself. \\\n",
    "You're taking steps to take care of yourself, and that's really important.\"\n",

    "The results presented are BLEU scores across seven different questions (Q1 to Q7) under various experimental conditions. Each question has four conditions evaluated: \"Only LoRA\", \"RAG and LoRA\", \"LoRA, RAG, and prompt template\", and \"LoRA and only prompt template\". BLEU scores are used to measure the similarity between generated text (responses) and reference text (ground truth). Generally, higher BLEU scores indicate better agreement with the reference text.\n",
    "\n",
    "- For Q1, the highest BLEU score (0.1027) is achieved with \"RAG and LoRA\" applied, indicating improved text quality compared to other conditions.\n",
    "- Q2 shows varying results with the highest BLEU score (0.0339) observed with \"Only LoRA\" applied, suggesting simpler models might perform better here.\n",
    "- Q3 consistently shows extremely low BLEU scores across all conditions, possibly indicating challenges in generating accurate responses for this question.\n",
    "- Q4 also displays varying performance, with notable differences between conditions, but generally lower scores.\n",
    "- Q5 exhibits extremely low BLEU scores across all conditions, indicating significant challenges in generating satisfactory responses.\n",
    "- Q6 shows a notable improvement in BLEU scores (up to 0.1039) when \"RAG and LoRA\" is applied, suggesting this combination enhances response quality.\n",
    "- Q7 again displays extremely low BLEU scores across all conditions, suggesting ongoing challenges in generating appropriate responses for this question.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, these results highlight the importance of experimental conditions, such as technique complexity with the LLM and prompt template usage, in influencing the quality of generated responses across different questions, with some conditions consistently outperforming others in specific contexts.\n",

    "- Impact of LoRA: In several questions (Q1, Q4, Q6), applying LoRA alone or in combination with other techniques generally compiled moderate BLEU scores, suggesting its positive impact on response quality.\n",
    "- Role of RAG: While RAG and LoRA combined (Q1, Q6) sometimes improved BLEU scores, RAG alone (Q2, Q4) did not consistently improve performance, indicating mixed results depending on the question.\n",
    "- Prompt template Usage:  Prompt templates generally assisted in improving BLEU scores in some conditions (Q2, Q4), suggesting their effectiveness in guiding response generation, but were less effective in others (Q1, Q6).\n",
    "- Challenges in Specific Questions: Q3, Q5, and Q7 consistently displayed extremely low BLEU scores across all conditions, highlighting persistent challenges in generating satisfactory responses for these particular questions, possibly due to subtle content or structural complexities.\n",
    "\n",
    "These insights underline the importance of tailoring model architectures and techniques to specific question types and content subtleties to achieve optimal performance in generating clear, consistent, logical and contextually relevant responses."
